# RAD
Resource for Application Development (R.A.D.)

This project will develop an online platform that offers insights and real-world examples of modern technologies in application development, empowering users to enhance their practical skills.

## Contribution Guidelines:

Container Creation: Contributors are required to independently create and submit their own containers. Each container must encapsulate the contributor's project or code.

Management: All submitted containers will be orchestrated using Kubernetes. This ensures scalability, manageability, and efficient deployment across the platform.

Topic Selection: Contributors have the freedom to select their own topics. Possible areas include, but are not limited to, API development, programming languages, database management, data science, and video game development.

Depth of Content: Topics can be explored at any depth, from foundational basics to advanced technical levels. Contributors are encouraged to delve into their subjects as deeply as their expertise allows.

Contribution Volume: There is no minimum or maximum limit on contributions. Participants can submit as many or as few containers as they wish.

Integration: All individual containers will be interconnected with a central main container. This integration facilitates a cohesive structure and interaction between the different modules.
